## JetBrains Mono for Apple
This is a configuration profile for iOS, iPadOS and MacOS that includes the entire JetBrain Mono font and all its variations (italic, bold, thin, ect.). This was made so you don’t have to install each of the 32 fonts separately through some half-gigabyte ad-infested font app. Also includes the (very crappy) code I used to make it. Perhaps I’ll make a website to do this online at some point.

#### The story
I want all variations of JetBrain Mono in one profile, I spend two hours on an iPad making a script to do it. If my code sucks it’s because I typed it on an iPad. Also not tested in anything other than Pythonista.

#### Updates
-26/11/2022: Literally changed a ONE LETTER bug and not it works in Python 3, seriously?!?
